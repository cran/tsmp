tsmp 0.3.1.9000
===============

-   Fixed Matrix Profile print, dimensions are now reported correctly.
-   Fixed pipe imports. Issue \#22
-   Fixed bug with `vars`. Issue \#23
-   Changed package license to GPL-3.
-   Changed verbose mode, added one more step to separate messages from
    progression bar.
-   Fixed SCRIMP and added PRE-SCRIMP, so this is the SCRIMP++. AB-join
    not yet implemented.
-   Changed progress bar for a better one from `progress` package.
-   Added Print and Plot to SiMPle. Issue \#24
-   Added Print and Plot to Salient.

tsmp 0.3.1
==========

IMPORTANT
---------

-   This version is a complete restructuration. The API has changed, and
    the workflow is more friendly. This API is intended to be stable,
    and from now on any change will pass through the “Deprecated” stage.

Added Features
--------------

-   Outputs have a prettier print format.
-   Outputs have a plot function. Try to plot a `tsmp()` output for
    example.
-   Now functions can work in `%>%` (pipe), e.g.
    `tsmp() %>% find_motif()`. Except for SDTS that has a proper way to
    work.
-   Added a wrapper function called `tsmp()` that handles the several
    algorithms available.
-   Added `as.*` functions to allow you to switch classes if you want,
    e.g.: `as.matrixprofile()`.
-   Changed all functions from dotted.case to snake\_case (except `as.*`
    functions).
-   Added Annotation Vectors.
-   Fixed STOMP crash with Joins.
-   Added support to query &lt; data in Joins.
-   SCRIMP (experimental).

tsmp 0.2.15
===========

-   Code linting.
-   Added Salient Subsequences search.

tsmp 0.2.14
===========

-   Added SiMPle (Fast Similarity Matrix Profile for Music Analysis and
    Exploration).
-   Added FLUSS (Fast Low-cost Unipotent Semantic Segmentation).
-   Added \[find\_chains()\] to look for chains primitives.
-   Added Multivariate MOTIF Search (from mSTOMP)
-   Changed dependency from beepr to audio (actually beepr depends on
    audio, so fewer dependencies).
-   Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

tsmp 0.2.12
===========

-   Added Multivariate STOMP parallel version.
-   Added SDTS algorithm (Scalable Dictionary learning for Time Series).

tsmp 0.1.0
==========

-   STAMP and STAMP parallel Algorithm.
-   Multivariate STOMP algorithm.
-   MASS algorithm.
